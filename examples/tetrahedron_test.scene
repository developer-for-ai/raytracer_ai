# Load the tetrahedron OBJ file (should be supported in future)
# For now, manually define the tetrahedron geometry:

# Default gray material  
material default 0.7 0.7 0.7 lambertian

# Add some lighting

# The four triangular faces of the tetrahedron:
# Face 1: vertices 1, 2, 3 -> (0,1,0), (-0.866,-0.5,-0.5), (0.866,-0.5,-0.5)
# Face 2: vertices 1, 3, 4 -> (0,1,0), (0.866,-0.5,-0.5), (0,-0.5,1) 
# Face 3: vertices 1, 4, 2 -> (0,1,0), (0,-0.5,1), (-0.866,-0.5,-0.5)
# Face 4: vertices 2, 4, 3 -> (-0.866,-0.5,-0.5), (0,-0.5,1), (0.866,-0.5,-0.5)
