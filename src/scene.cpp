#include "scene.h"

// Scene implementation is mostly header-only for performance
// This file exists for future scene-specific implementations that don't belong in the header

// Currently, all Scene methods are implemented inline in scene.h for optimal performance
// Future additions might include:
// - Complex scene loading utilities
// - Scene optimization algorithms
// - Scene serialization methods
