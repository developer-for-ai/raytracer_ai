## 🚀 Getting Started

### Build System
```bash
# Install dependencies (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt install libglfw3-dev libglew-dev libgl1-mesa-dev

# Build GPU raytracer
./build.sh

# Or manual build
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
```

### Quick Start
```bash
# Interactive real-time exploration (requires display)
./build/bin/RayTracerGPU examples/cornell_box.scene

# High-quality file output (headless rendering)
./build/bin/RayTracerGPU examples/showcase.scene -o render.ppm -w 1920 -h 1080 -s 16

# Lighting demonstration
./build/bin/RayTracerGPU examples/lighting_demo.scene -o lighting.ppm -w 1200 -h 900 -s 12
```

## 🎮 Interactive Controls

When running the GPU raytracer:
- **WASD** - Move camera forward/left/backward/right
- **Left Click** - Toggle mouse capture for camera look (click to capture, click again to release)
- **Mouse** - Look around when captured (first-person camera)
- **Arrow Keys** - Look around (alternative to mouse, works even without mouse capture)
- **Space** - Move up
- **Shift** - Move down
- **R** - Reset camera to initial position and orientation
- **F1** - Toggle detailed performance stats in window title
- **ESC** - Exit

> 💡 **Tip**: Click anywhere in the window to start looking around. The mouse cursor will be hidden and locked to the window. Click again to release the mouse and return to normal cursor behavior.

> 🎯 **Alternative Look Controls**: Use the arrow keys to look around without capturing the mouse - great for precise camera adjustments!

> 🔄 **Camera Reset**: If you lose the scene or get disoriented, press **R** to reset the camera to its original position and view angle.

> 📊 **Performance**: The window title shows real-time FPS and frame time. Press F1 to toggle between simple and detailed performance displays.
